# React Enhanced Crisis Managment System 

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web service designed to manage Criss Managment System, facilitating the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of session information. It serves as an essential tool for crisis counseling management, allowing for easy tracking and adjustments of session details. The front end is built with React, leveraging Vite for an enhanced development experience, while the back end handles RESTful API requests for data management.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Powers the front-end user interface, located in the Client folder.
- **Vite**: Utilized for a faster development server, improved hot-reloading, and support for modern JavaScript features.
- **CORS**: Enables cross-origin requests to the API.
